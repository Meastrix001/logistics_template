My name is Stiina Roofthooft, and I am 24 years old. I‚Äôm new to the beauty industry, but I promise to do my work professionally and with heart. I completed a basic and Brazilian waxing course in August 2024 at the Lycon-Soulin O√ú salon. Since then, I‚Äôve practiced on both myself and acquaintances, and I can confidently say that I am now ready to welcome clients. ü•≥`,

Saara, our quiet but strict 15-year-old cat; Gin, our family ‚Äúteenager,‚Äù a 2-year-old cat; and Bambi, an 8-year-old princess dog. All of our animals came to us through rescue from difficult situations, and we are now able to provide them with a safe and comfortable home.`,

        question: "Does waxing hurt?",

          "You may feel some discomfort, especially on your first visit. Most clients say it‚Äôs quick and gets easier with each session as hair grows back finer.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long should my hair be before waxing?",
        answer:
          "Hair should be at least 0.2 cm long (about the length of a grain of rice) for the wax to grip properly. Avoid shaving at least 2 - 3 weeks before your appointment.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is waxing safe for sensitive skin?",
        answer:
          "Yes! I use premium waxes like Lycon that are formulated for sensitive skin. If you have concerns, let us know so I can adjust the treatment.",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do before my first wax?",
        answer:
          "Don't exfoliate for a week before, if you have any skin conditions or concerns then let me know, go take a shower and wear comfortable clother if possible.",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I avoid after waxing?",
        answer:
          "For the next 24 hours avoid bathing, saunas, tanning, intense workouts, sex and skin treatments/makeup. Those activities can cause irritation and ingrown hairs.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long will the results last?",
        answer:
          "Results typically last 2 - 4 weeks depending on your hair growth cycle. With regular waxing, hair grows back slower and finer.",
      },
      {
        question: "I‚Äôm nervous - is it normal to feel that way?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! Many first-time clients feel nervous. Next appointments will be much comfortable already. If you have any questions regarding that then please don't hesitate to contact me.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I wax if I‚Äôm pregnant?",
        answer:
          "Yes, waxing is generally safe during pregnancy, though your skin may be more sensitive. Always consult with your doctor first if you‚Äôre unsure.",
      },
      {
        question: "Will waxing cause ingrown hairs?",
        answer:
          "If proper aftercare is followed, waxing usually reduces ingrown hairs compared to shaving. Regular exfoliation and moisturizing help keep skin smooth.",
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I book a appointment?",
        answer:
          "It is recommended to repeat this every 3 - 5 weeks for best results. Staying consistent helps reduce discomfort, maintain smooth skin, and prevents hair from growing back too long and thick.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I shave before the appointment?",
        answer:
          "It is not recommended to shave for at least 2 - 3 weeks before your appointment. Otherwise, the wax will not hold the hairs properly and can cause inconsistent results.",
